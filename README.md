Intensity-Analysis
Build your own model using NLP and Python


Steps to Follow

Data Collection
Gather text data with labeled intensities from various sources.
Ensure the dataset is diverse to cover different expressions of emotions.

Data Preprocessing

Clean the text data (remove noise, handle missing values).
Tokenize the text, remove stop words, and perform lemmatization or stemming.
Feature Engineering
Extract features such as word counts, TF-IDF scores, sentiment scores, etc.
Consider using pre-trained embeddings like Word2Vec or BERT for richer feature representation.
Train/Test Split
Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split).
Model Selection
Experiment with different models like Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and deep learning models like LSTM or BERT.
Use cross-validation to select the best model.

Model Training
Train the selected models on the training data.
Monitor training performance and avoid overfitting.
Model Evaluation
Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
Ensure the model achieves an accuracy of >85% on the test set.
Hyperparameter Tuning
Use techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to optimize hyperparameters.
Fine-tune the model for better performance.
Model Deployment
Develop a plan to deploy the model in a production environment.
Consider using platforms like Flask or FastAPI for creating an API.
